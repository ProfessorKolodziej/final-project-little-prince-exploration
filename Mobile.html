          Our first destination is your planet! Everything one ever knows is here. This is the only place where life is known to currently exist.

           Next we are going to visit the Martians! The Red Planet is the most likely candidate for a future human habitat. It is affected by huge dust storms and cover the entire planet!

         Jupiter </h3>
         <p class="overview-planets">
           Next is the largest planet in the solar system! Jupiter has some of the largest moons in the solar system and one in particular, Europa might be able to sustain life in an ocean below its icy surface.

          Saturn </h3>
         <p class="overview-planets">
          Next we will land on Saturn’s rings! Saturn is the second largest planet and is known for its rings, although the other gas giants also have these kinds of rings, only Saturn’s rings can be seen the clearest.

        Did you know that I'm the third planet from the Sun and the largest of the terrestrial planets. And I'm the only planet in our solar system not to be named after a Greek or Roman deity. I was formed approximately 4.54 billion years ago and I’m the only known planet to support life.

      I'm very cold and dry but water exists in form of ice at my North and South poles. My surface has many craters, deep valleys and volcanoes. The largest peak on the red planet is a volcano called Olympus Mons, which is three times higher than Mount Everest, the highest mountain on Earth.

       Did you know that I'm the largest planet in the solar system. The most famous feature on my surface is the ‘Great Red Spot’ which is actually a storm that has been blowing for about 350 years, if not longer. I have some of the largest moons in the solar system and one in particular, Europa might be able to sustain life in an ocean below its icy surface.

      I'm a gas giant just like Jupiter, Neptune and Uranus. This means that I don't really have a proper solid surface as it is mainly made up of gases with a small rocky core. I'm the second largest planet and is known for my rings, although the other gas giants also have these kinds of rings, only my rings can be seen the clearest. Saturn's moon, Titan is the second largest in the solar system.
